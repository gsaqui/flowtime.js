section 2 page 2 - Agile rollout
- started 7 years ago 
  - I was there for 5 of them
  - Part of the team that was brought in to show what we could do

Section 2 page 3 - Our team
  - The whole idea is we were all full stack developers
  - Paired full time
  - This can be very challenging in many respects which I can go into later if anyone would like to hear more about it
  - no email
  - no phone
  - nothing to distract you
  - This meant we paired on everything from from sysadmin work to ie tweaks (we had to support ie6 for a while)


Section 2 page 4 - Team make up
  - QA weren't just testers their job was to ensure it's a quality experience for the user and to work with product owner to make sure their vision is matched with what had built
  - scrum master role was subservient leadership   
     - man management

Section 2 page 5 - Environment
  - fosters communication
  - tried different configurations but found this to be the best

Section 2 page 6 - boards
  - dashboards 
  - build server, holidays by the stand up area, baord to show how far away a branch is from master

Setion 3 page 1
	- visible -> Anyone can come into bullpen at any time and see what is going on - and everyone was welcome to come in and see what we were working on
	- Lean -> the goal was to keep the code in the repository for as short of time as possible
	- Heartbeat -> daily standups, retrospectives, 
	- Team -> each person had a voice and everyone had to respect that - without respect and are equal it all fails

Section 3 page 3
	- Started out as a weekly release cycle - but this was really because we weren't branching properly
	- Went from SVN to GIT and decided to change our process to use some of the features of git - mainly easier branching
